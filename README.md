# 3D Scene Graphics - Computer Graphics and Image Processing Project

This project, undertaken as part of the "Computer Graphics and Image Processing" course, involves the creation of an interactive 3D scene using the PyOpenGL library in Python. The objective is to showcase various basic 3D objects in the scene, making them controllable through user interaction.

## Features

The scene includes a torus, a cube, and a teapot. These objects are rendered using OpenGL functions such as 'glutSolidTorus', 'glutSolidCube', and 'glutSolidTeapot.' Additionally, lighting has been implemented in the scene, utilizing a point light source to illuminate the objects.

## User Interaction

User interaction allows for exploring the scene. Mouse movement controls the rotation of the scene, while the right mouse button is used for zooming. Keyboard inputs enable changes in the viewing direction and zoom level.

## Demonstration

The project not only demonstrates the application of 3D graphics and OpenGL but also showcases an understanding of lighting effects, materials, and transformations in a 3D scene. The implementation takes into account the theoretical concepts and practical exercises covered in the course.
